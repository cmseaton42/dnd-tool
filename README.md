Here is the [site](https://cmseaton42.github.io/dnd-tool/). It should be fairly intuitive and hopefully is great when you need a quick tracker in a pinch :).

### Features that may be added later

-   Pulling in Monster Stat Blocks from SRD
-   Status Condition Tracking
-   Others that you guys may think would be useful, what you see is about 5 hours of work so there is _ALOT_ that can still be done :)

My aim is to make a super lite weight version of what `improved initiative` has to offer with slightly better UI/UX.
